## ‚ö†Ô∏è If You See Errors

**Common Issues:**

**1. "syntax error near..."**
- Copy the ENTIRE file (check you didn't miss the beginning or end)
- Make sure you're pasting into a NEW query, not an existing one

**2. "relation already exists"**
- Tables already created (someone ran it before)
- Either:
  - Drop all tables first (risky)
  - Or skip this step (schema already deployed)

**3. "permission denied"**
- Make sure you're logged in as owner
- Check project permissions

**4. "function auth.uid() does not exist"**
- Supabase auth not enabled
- Go to Authentication ‚Üí Enable

## üì∏ Screenshot Checklist

After deployment, you can verify by:
1. Table Editor shows 24 tables
2. Any table shows üîí icon (RLS enabled)
3. compliance_jurisdictions has data
4. No error messages in SQL editor
