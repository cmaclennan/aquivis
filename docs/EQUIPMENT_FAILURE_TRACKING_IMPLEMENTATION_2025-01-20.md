**Date:** 2025-01-20  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Priority:** MEDIUM (HIGH VALUE)

---

## 🎯 OBJECTIVE

Implement comprehensive equipment failure tracking to monitor equipment reliability, identify problem equipment, and track repair costs.

---

## ✅ WHAT WAS IMPLEMENTED

### 1. Database Schema
**File:** `sql/CREATE_EQUIPMENT_FAILURES.sql`

**Table:** `equipment_failures`

**Columns:**
- `id` - UUID primary key
- `equipment_id` - References equipment (CASCADE delete)
- `service_id` - Optional reference to service (SET NULL delete)
- `failure_date` - Timestamp of failure (default NOW)
- `failure_type` - mechanical, electrical, leak, performance, wear, other
- `severity` - minor, major, critical
- `description` - Text description of failure
- `resolved` - Boolean (default false)
- `resolved_date` - Timestamp when resolved
- `resolved_by` - References profiles
- `resolution_notes` - Text notes about resolution
- `parts_cost` - Decimal(10,2) cost of parts
- `labor_cost` - Decimal(10,2) cost of labor
- `total_cost` - Generated column (parts_cost + labor_cost)
- `downtime_hours` - Decimal(6,2) hours out of service
- `reported_by` - References profiles
- `created_at` - Timestamp
- `updated_at` - Timestamp (auto-updated)

**Indexes:**
- `idx_equipment_failures_equipment` - On (equipment_id, failure_date DESC)
- `idx_equipment_failures_unresolved` - On equipment_id WHERE resolved = false
- `idx_equipment_failures_severity` - On (severity, failure_date DESC) WHERE resolved = false
- `idx_equipment_failures_service` - On service_id WHERE service_id IS NOT NULL

**RLS Policies:**
- Users can view failures for equipment in their company
