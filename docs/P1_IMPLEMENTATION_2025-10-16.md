# P1 Implementation – 2025-10-16

## Summary of Changes
- Properties page now uses `properties_optimized` with pagination (24/page) and `loading.tsx` skeleton.
- Customers page now uses `customers_optimized` with pagination (24/page) and `loading.tsx` skeleton.

## Files Updated
- `app/(dashboard)/properties/page.tsx`
- `app/(dashboard)/properties/loading.tsx`
- `app/(dashboard)/customers/page.tsx`
- `app/(dashboard)/customers/loading.tsx`

## Behavior
- Server-side pagination using Supabase `.range(from, to)`.
- Counts rendered from optimized views for faster queries.
- Skeletons display immediately for perceived speed.

## Testing Steps
1. Local
   - `npm run build` (should succeed)
   - Navigate to `/properties` and `/customers`; verify lists render fast.
   - Test pagination: `?page=1`, `?page=2` (if enough data).
2. Production
   - After deploy, time initial load p95 (target ≤ 2s) using Sentry/DevTools.
   - Verify RLS still applied (authorized users only).

## Follow-ups
- Add pagination to services list.
- Batch fetch optimization for schedule page.
- Generate Supabase types and enable strict TS.
