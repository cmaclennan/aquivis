## 💡 Key Learnings

### **What Worked Well:**
- Comprehensive planning before coding
- Systematic validation (eventually!)
- Issue logging prevents repeated mistakes
- Clean git history with meaningful commits

### **What Needs Improvement:**
- Validation must be systematic from start (not after errors)
- Test SQL before user deploys
- Take time to be thorough upfront
- Never claim "validated" without proof

### **Process Improvements Implemented:**
- Created `PRE_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` (15-point validation)
- Created `SCHEMA_LINE_BY_LINE_REVIEW.md`
- Created `DATABASE_ORDER_VALIDATION.md`
- All future work will use systematic validation
