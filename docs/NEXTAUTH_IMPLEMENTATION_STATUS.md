**Status:** ‚úÖ PHASE 1 & 2 COMPLETE - Ready for Testing
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-21
**Timeline:** 2 of 4 days complete

---

## ‚úÖ PHASE 1: Setup & Configuration (COMPLETE)

### Completed Tasks:
- [x] Installed `next-auth@beta` package
- [x] Created `lib/auth.ts` with NextAuth configuration
  - Credentials provider for email/password
  - JWT callbacks for role and company_id
  - Session strategy set to JWT
  - 24-hour session timeout
- [x] Created `app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts` API handler
- [x] Created `types/next-auth.d.ts` for TypeScript support
- [x] Added NEXTAUTH_URL and NEXTAUTH_SECRET to .env.local
- [x] Build succeeds with no errors

### Files Created:
- `lib/auth.ts` - NextAuth configuration
- `app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts` - API handler
- `types/next-auth.d.ts` - TypeScript types

---

## ‚úÖ PHASE 2: Protected Routes & Middleware (COMPLETE)

### Updated Login Pages:
- [x] `/login` - Uses `signIn('credentials')` with NextAuth
- [x] `/super-admin-login` - Uses `signIn('credentials')` with role check
- [x] `/customer-portal/login` - Uses `signIn('credentials')`

### Updated Protected Layouts:
- [x] `app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx` - Uses `auth()` from NextAuth
- [x] `app/super-admin/layout.tsx` - Uses `auth()` with role check
- [x] `app/customer-portal/layout.tsx` - Uses `auth()` from NextAuth

### Updated Middleware:
- [x] `middleware.ts` - Checks NextAuth JWT token
- [x] Role-based redirects (super-admin vs regular user)
- [x] Redirects authenticated users away from login pages
- [x] Protects all dashboard routes

### Files Modified:
- `app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`
- `app/super-admin-login/page.tsx`
- `app/customer-portal/login/page.tsx`
- `app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx`
- `app/super-admin/layout.tsx`
- `app/customer-portal/layout.tsx`
- `middleware.ts`
- `lib/auth.ts`
- `app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`

## üîÑ PHASE 3: Testing (IN PROGRESS)

### What to Test:
1. **Regular User Login**
   - [ ] Can log in with valid credentials
   - [ ] Redirects to `/dashboard`
   - [ ] Session persists across navigation
   - [ ] Can access dashboard pages

2. **Super Admin Login**
   - [ ] Can log in with super admin account
   - [ ] Redirects to `/super-admin`
   - [ ] Cannot access regular dashboard
   - [ ] Session persists

3. **Customer Portal Login**
   - [ ] Can log in with customer account
   - [ ] Redirects to `/customer-portal`
   - [ ] Can access customer portal pages

4. **Session Persistence**
   - [ ] Cookies persist across page navigation
   - [ ] Session doesn't disappear after 1 second
   - [ ] Can refresh page and stay logged in

5. **Role-Based Access Control**
   - [ ] Non-super-admin cannot access `/super-admin`
   - [ ] Non-customer cannot access `/customer-portal`
   - [ ] Unauthenticated users redirected to login

6. **Logout**
   - [ ] Logout works from all 3 areas
   - [ ] Redirects to appropriate login page
   - [ ] Session cleared

---

## üìã PHASE 4: Deployment (PENDING)

### Steps:
1. Set environment variables in Vercel
   - NEXTAUTH_URL (production URL)
   - NEXTAUTH_SECRET (same as local)
2. Deploy to staging
3. Test on staging
4. Deploy to production

---

## üîß Technical Details

### NextAuth Configuration:
- **Provider:** Credentials (email/password)
- **Session Strategy:** JWT
- **Session Duration:** 24 hours
- **Callbacks:** JWT and Session callbacks for role/company_id

### Auth Flow:
1. User submits login form
2. `signIn('credentials')` calls CredentialsProvider
3. Provider authenticates with Supabase
4. JWT token created with user data
5. Session established
6. User redirected based on role

### Key Files:
- `lib/auth.ts` - Core auth configuration
- `app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts` - API endpoint
- `middleware.ts` - Route protection
- Layout files - Session checks

---

## ‚úÖ Build Status

**Latest Build:** ‚úÖ SUCCESS
- No errors
- No warnings
- All routes compiled
- Middleware compiled (101 kB)

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Test locally** - Run `npm run dev` and test all 3 login flows
2. **Verify session persistence** - Check cookies don't disappear
3. **Test role-based access** - Verify redirects work correctly
4. **Deploy to Vercel** - Set env vars and deploy
5. **Test on production** - Verify everything works

---

## üìù Notes

- Supabase is still used for data storage and RLS
- NextAuth handles authentication and sessions only
- No database schema changes needed (NextAuth uses JWT, not sessions table)
- All existing Supabase functionality preserved
- Rate limiting and login attempt logging still work via RPC functions
