# Rate Limiting Implementation
**Date:** 2025-01-20  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Priority:** HIGH - Security Critical

---

## 🎯 OBJECTIVE

Implement comprehensive rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks on login endpoints with:
- Failed login attempt tracking
- Automatic account lockout after 5 failed attempts
- 30-minute lockout duration
- IP-based rate limiting
- Manual unlock capability for super admins

---

## 🚨 SECURITY THREAT ADDRESSED

**Brute Force Attacks:**
- Attackers try many password combinations
- Can compromise accounts with weak passwords
- Can cause service degradation
- Can be used for credential stuffing

**Our Solution:**
- ✅ Limit to 5 failed attempts per email in 15 minutes
- ✅ Limit to 10 failed attempts per IP in 15 minutes
- ✅ 30-minute account lockout after 5 failures
- ✅ All attempts logged for security auditing
- ✅ Super admin can manually unlock accounts

---

## ✅ WHAT WAS IMPLEMENTED

### 1. Database Tables

#### `login_attempts`
**Purpose:** Track all login attempts (success and failure)

**Columns:**
- `id` - UUID primary key
- `email` - Email address used for login
- `ip_address` - IP address of attempt
- `user_agent` - Browser/client user agent
- `attempt_time` - Timestamp of attempt
- `success` - Boolean (true = successful login)
- `failure_reason` - Reason for failure
- `user_id` - User ID (if successful)

**Indexes:**
- `idx_login_attempts_email_time` - Fast email-based queries
- `idx_login_attempts_ip_time` - Fast IP-based queries
- `idx_login_attempts_success` - Fast success/failure queries

**Retention:** 30 days (auto-cleanup)

---

#### `account_lockouts`
**Purpose:** Track locked accounts

**Columns:**
- `id` - UUID primary key
- `email` - Locked email address (UNIQUE)
- `locked_at` - When account was locked
- `locked_until` - When lockout expires
- `lock_reason` - Reason for lockout
- `failed_attempts` - Number of failed attempts
- `unlocked_at` - When manually unlocked
- `unlocked_by` - Super admin who unlocked
- `unlock_reason` - Reason for unlock

**Indexes:**
- `idx_account_lockouts_email` - Fast email lookups
- `idx_account_lockouts_locked_until` - Fast expiry checks
- `idx_account_lockouts_active` - Fast active lockout queries

---

### 2. Database Functions

#### `log_login_attempt()`
**Purpose:** Log every login attempt

**Parameters:**
- `p_email` - Email address
- `p_ip_address` - IP address (optional)
- `p_user_agent` - User agent (optional)
- `p_success` - Success boolean
- `p_failure_reason` - Failure reason (optional)
- `p_user_id` - User ID (optional)

**Usage:**
```typescript
await supabase.rpc('log_login_attempt', {
  p_email: 'user@example.com',
  p_ip_address: '192.168.1.1',
  p_user_agent: 'Mozilla/5.0...',
  p_success: false,
  p_failure_reason: 'Invalid password',
  p_user_id: null
})
```

---

#### `check_rate_limit()`
**Purpose:** Check if login is allowed based on rate limiting rules

**Parameters:**
- `p_email` - Email address
- `p_ip_address` - IP address (optional)

**Returns:** JSON object with:
- `allowed` - Boolean (true = can login)
- `reason` - Reason if not allowed
- `locked_until` - Lockout expiry (if locked)
- `message` - User-friendly message
- `email_attempts` - Number of attempts (if allowed)
- `ip_attempts` - Number of IP attempts (if allowed)

**Logic:**
1. Check if account is currently locked
2. Count failed attempts by email in last 15 minutes
3. Count failed attempts by IP in last 15 minutes
4. Lock account if ≥5 email attempts
5. Block if ≥10 IP attempts
6. Return allowed/denied with reason

**Usage:**
```typescript
const { data } = await supabase.rpc('check_rate_limit', {
  p_email: 'user@example.com',
  p_ip_address: '192.168.1.1'
})

if (!data.allowed) {
  return { error: data.message }
}
```

---

#### `unlock_account()`
**Purpose:** Manually unlock a locked account (super admin only)

**Parameters:**
- `p_email` - Email to unlock
- `p_unlock_reason` - Reason for unlock

**Security:** Only super admins can call this function

**Usage:**
```typescript
await supabase.rpc('unlock_account', {
  p_email: 'user@example.com',
  p_unlock_reason: 'User verified via phone'
})
```

---

#### `clean_old_login_attempts()`
**Purpose:** Clean up old data (30+ days)

**Usage:** Should be run periodically (cron job)

---

### 3. Updated Login Actions

All three login actions now include rate limiting:

1. **Normal Login** (`app/(auth)/login/actions.ts`)
2. **Customer Portal Login** (`app/customer-portal/login/actions.ts`)
3. **Super Admin Login** (`app/super-admin-login/actions.ts`)

**Flow for each:**
1. Check rate limit before attempting login
2. If not allowed, log attempt and return error
3. Attempt login with Supabase
4. If login fails, log failed attempt
5. If login succeeds, log successful attempt
6. Continue with normal login flow

---

## 📊 RATE LIMITING RULES

### Email-Based Limits
- **Threshold:** 5 failed attempts in 15 minutes
- **Action:** Lock account for 30 minutes
- **Reason:** Prevent password guessing on specific account

### IP-Based Limits
- **Threshold:** 10 failed attempts in 15 minutes
- **Action:** Block all logins from IP
- **Reason:** Prevent distributed attacks from single IP

### Lockout Duration
- **Duration:** 30 minutes
- **Auto-unlock:** Yes (after 30 minutes)
- **Manual unlock:** Yes (super admin only)

---

## 🧪 TESTING

### Test 1: Normal Login (Under Limit)
1. Try to login with wrong password (1st attempt)
2. **Expected:** Error message, attempt logged
3. Try again (2nd attempt)
4. **Expected:** Error message, attempt logged
5. Login with correct password
6. **Expected:** Success, attempt logged

### Test 2: Account Lockout
1. Try to login with wrong password 5 times
2. **Expected:** After 5th attempt, account locked
3. Try to login with correct password
4. **Expected:** Error: "Account is locked for 30 minutes"
5. Wait 30 minutes (or manually unlock)
6. Try to login with correct password
7. **Expected:** Success

### Test 3: IP Rate Limit
1. Try to login to 10 different accounts with wrong passwords
2. **Expected:** After 10th attempt, IP blocked
3. Try to login to any account
4. **Expected:** Error: "Too many attempts from this IP"

### Test 4: Manual Unlock
1. Lock an account (5 failed attempts)
2. Login as super admin
3. Call `unlock_account()` function
4. Try to login to unlocked account
5. **Expected:** Success

## 📊 MONITORING & ANALYTICS

### What Can Be Monitored
1. **Failed Login Attempts**
   - By email
   - By IP address
   - By time period

2. **Account Lockouts**
   - Number of lockouts
   - Most locked accounts
   - Lockout reasons

3. **Attack Patterns**
   - Distributed attacks (many IPs)
   - Targeted attacks (single account)
   - Credential stuffing attempts

### Queries for Monitoring

**Failed attempts in last hour:**
```sql
SELECT email, COUNT(*) as attempts
FROM login_attempts
WHERE success = false
  AND attempt_time > now() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
GROUP BY email
ORDER BY attempts DESC;
```

**Currently locked accounts:**
```sql
SELECT email, locked_at, locked_until, failed_attempts
FROM account_lockouts
WHERE unlocked_at IS NULL
  AND locked_until > now()
ORDER BY locked_at DESC;
```

**Top attacking IPs:**
```sql
SELECT ip_address, COUNT(*) as attempts
FROM login_attempts
WHERE success = false
  AND attempt_time > now() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY ip_address
ORDER BY attempts DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
