  units!inner(name, properties!inner(name, customer_id), customer_id),
  water_tests(id, ph, chlorine, alkalinity, ...)
`)
.or(orServices) // Customer filter
.order('service_date', { ascending: false })
```

### Service Detail Query
```typescript
.from('services')
.select(`
  id, service_date, service_type, status, notes,
  units!inner(...),
  water_tests(...),
  service_chemicals(...),
  service_photos(...)
`)
.eq('id', serviceId)
.single()
```

### Water Tests Query
```typescript
.from('water_tests')
.select(`
  id, ph, chlorine, alkalinity, ...,
  service:services!inner(
    id, service_date,
    units!inner(name, properties!inner(name, customer_id), customer_id)
