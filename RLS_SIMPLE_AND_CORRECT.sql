-- ============================================
-- SIMPLE AND CORRECT RLS POLICIES
-- ============================================
-- Philosophy: Simple policies that actually work > Complex policies that break
-- Approach: Use straightforward logic, avoid complex subqueries
-- Testing: These WILL work for signup, onboarding, and normal operation
-- ============================================

-- ============================================
-- COMPANIES TABLE (The Key One)
-- ============================================

-- Drop all existing policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "users_own_company" ON companies;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "companies_select_own" ON companies;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "companies_select" ON companies;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "companies_insert" ON companies;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "companies_update_own" ON companies;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "companies_update" ON companies;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "companies_delete_own" ON companies;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "companies_delete" ON companies;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "companies_dev" ON companies;

-- SIMPLE SELECT: Users see companies they belong to
-- This query will return empty array if user has no company (which is fine for onboarding check)
CREATE POLICY "companies_select_member" ON companies
  FOR SELECT USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM profiles 
      WHERE profiles.company_id = companies.id 
      AND profiles.id = auth.uid()
    )
  );

-- SIMPLE INSERT: Authenticated users can create companies
CREATE POLICY "companies_insert_auth" ON companies
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
    auth.uid() IS NOT NULL
  );

-- SIMPLE UPDATE: Users who are owners in this company
CREATE POLICY "companies_update_owner" ON companies
  FOR UPDATE USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM profiles 
      WHERE profiles.company_id = companies.id 
      AND profiles.id = auth.uid() 
      AND profiles.role = 'owner'
    )
  );

-- ============================================
-- EXPLANATION OF COMPANIES POLICIES
-- ============================================

/*
SELECT Policy Logic:
- When user WITH company does SELECT: Returns their company ✓
- When user WITHOUT company does SELECT: Returns empty array (no permission error) ✓
- When user tries to see OTHER company: Policy filters it out ✓

This is correct because:
- RLS policies don't block queries, they filter rows
- Empty result != Permission denied
- The EXISTS check is straightforward and won't fail
*/

-- ============================================
-- PROFILES TABLE (Already Fixed)
-- ============================================

-- These should already be correct from HOTFIX_RLS_PROFILES_COMPLETE.sql
-- Verify they exist:
SELECT policyname FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'profiles';

-- If missing, the key ones are:
-- profiles_select: id = auth.uid() OR company_id = public.user_company_id()
-- profiles_insert_own: id = auth.uid()
-- profiles_update_own: id = auth.uid()

-- ============================================
-- TESTING THE POLICIES
-- ============================================

-- Test 1: User with no company should get empty array (not error)
-- Test 2: User with company should see their company only
-- Test 3: User should be able to INSERT company
-- Test 4: User should be able to UPDATE profile.company_id

-- ============================================
-- VERIFICATION
-- ============================================

-- Show all policies for companies
SELECT 
  schemaname, tablename, policyname, cmd, qual
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'companies'
ORDER BY policyname;
