## Vulnerabilities Found (4 total)

### 1. Next.js - CRITICAL + HIGH (multiple)
- **Package:** next 15.1.0
- **Fix Available:** Upgrade to next@15.5.4
- **Issues:**
  - DoS via Server Actions
  - Race Condition to Cache Poisoning
  - Information exposure in dev server
  - DoS via cache poisoning
  - Cache Key Confusion for Image Optimization
  - Authorization Bypass in Middleware
  - Content Injection for Image Optimization
  - SSRF via Improper Middleware Redirect

**Severity:** CRITICAL (multiple security issues)

**Decision:** âœ… UPGRADE to 15.5.4
- Minor version bump (15.1.0 â†’ 15.5.4)
- Security fixes essential
- No breaking changes expected (same major version)
- No code written yet, safe to upgrade

### 2. jspdf + dompurify - MODERATE + HIGH
- **Package:** jspdf <=3.0.1, dompurify <3.2.4
- **Fix Available:** Upgrade jspdf to 3.0.3
- **Issue:** XSS vulnerability in DOMPurify
- **Used for:** PDF report generation (billing, compliance certificates)

**Severity:** MODERATE to HIGH (XSS risk)

**Decision:** âœ… UPGRADE jspdf to 3.0.3
- May have breaking changes (3.0.1 â†’ 3.0.3)
- But we haven't written PDF code yet
- Essential for secure report generation
- Will verify PDF functionality when we build reports

## Resolution

### Command to Run:
```bash
npm audit fix --force
```

**What it does:**
- Upgrades Next.js to 15.5.4 (security fixes)
- Upgrades jspdf to 3.0.3 (XSS fix)
- May update other dependencies

**Risks:**
- `--force` may introduce breaking changes
- But we have no code yet, so safe
- Better to fix now than later

**After running:**
1. Verify package.json updated
2. Test dev server still works
3. Document in ISSUE_LOG.md
4. Commit changes

---

## Prevention

**Going forward:**
- Run `npm audit` after every dependency install
- Fix vulnerabilities immediately
- Document all security decisions
- Never ignore critical/high vulnerabilities
- Keep dependencies up to date

**Action Required:** Run `npm audit fix --force` to resolve all issues
